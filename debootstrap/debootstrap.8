.SH NAME
debootstrap \- Bootstrap a basic Devuan system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B debootstrap
.RB [ OPTION\&.\&.\&. ]
.I SUITE TARGET
.RI [ MIRROR
.RI [ SCRIPT ]]

.B debootstrap
.RB [ OPTION\&.\&.\&. ]
\-\-second\-stage
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B debootstrap
bootstraps a basic Devuan system of
.I SUITE
into
.I TARGET
from
.I MIRROR
by running
.IR SCRIPT .
.I MIRROR
can be an http:// or https:// URL, a file:/// URL, or an ssh:/// URL.
.PP
The
.I SUITE
may be a release code name (eg, ceres, ascii, jessie)
or a symbolic name (eg, unstable, testing, stable, oldstable)
.PP
Notice that file:/ URLs are translated to file:/// (correct scheme as
described in RFC1738 for local filenames), and file:// will \fBnot\fR work.
ssh://USER@HOST/PATH URLs are retrieved using
.BR scp ;
use of
.B ssh\-agent
or similar is strongly recommended.
.PP
\fBDebootstrap\fR can be used to install Devuan in a system without using an
installation disk but can also be used to run a different Devuan flavor in a \fBchroot\fR
environment.
This way you can create a full (minimal) Devuan installation which
can be used for testing purposes (see the \fBEXAMPLES\fR section). 
If you are looking for a chroot system to build packages please take a look at 
\fBpbuilder\fR.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
.IP "\fB\-\-arch=ARCH\fP"
Set the target architecture (use if dpkg isn't installed).
See also \-\-foreign.
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-include=alpha,beta\fP"
Comma separated list of packages which will be added to download and extract
lists.
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-exclude=alpha,beta\fP"
Comma separated list of packages which will be removed from download and
extract lists.
WARNING: you can and probably will exclude essential packages, be
careful using this option.
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-components=alpha,beta\fP"
Use packages from the listed components of the archive.
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-resolve\-deps\fP"
By default, debootstrap will attempt to automatically resolve any missing
dependencies, warning if any are found.
Note that this is not a complete dependency resolve in the sense of dpkg
or apt, and that it is far better to specify the entire base system than
rely on this option.
With this option set, this behaviour is disabled.
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-variant=minbase|buildd|fakechroot\fP"
Name of the bootstrap script variant to use.
Currently, the variants supported are minbase, which only includes
essential packages and apt; buildd, which installs the build-essential
packages into
.IR TARGET ;
and fakechroot, which installs the packages without root privileges.
The default, with no \fB\-\-variant=X\fP argument, is to create a base
Devuan installation in
.IR TARGET .
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-merged-usr\fP"
Create /{bin,sbin,lib}/ symlinks pointing to their counterparts in /usr/.
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-no-merged-usr\fP"
Do not create /{bin,sbin,lib}/ symlinks pointing to their counterparts in /usr/.
(Default.)
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-keyring=KEYRING\fP"
Override the default keyring for the distribution being bootstrapped,
and use
.IR KEYRING
to check signatures of retrieved Release files.
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-no-check-gpg\fP"
Disables checking gpg signatures of retrieved Release files.
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-force-check-gpg\fP"
Forces checking Release file signatures, disabling automatic fallback to
HTTPS in case of a missing keyring. Incompatible with the previous option.
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-verbose\fP"
Produce more info about downloading.
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-print\-debs\fP"
Print the packages to be installed, and exit.
Note that a TARGET directory must be specified so debootstrap can
download Packages files to determine which packages should be installed,
and to resolve dependencies.
The TARGET directory will be deleted unless \-\-keep\-debootstrap\-dir
is specified.
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-download\-only\fP"
Download packages, but don't perform installation.
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-foreign\fP"
Do the initial unpack phase of bootstrapping only, for example if the
target architecture does not match the host architecture.
A copy of debootstrap sufficient for completing the bootstrap process
will be installed as /debootstrap/debootstrap in the target filesystem.
You can run it with the \fB\-\-second\-stage\fP option to complete the
bootstrapping process.
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-second\-stage\fP"
Complete the bootstrapping process.
Other arguments are generally not needed.
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-second\-stage\-target=DIR\fP"
Run second stage in a subdirectory instead of root. (can be used to create
a foreign chroot) (requires \-\-second\-stage)
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-keep\-debootstrap\-dir\fP"
Don't delete the /debootstrap directory in the target after completing the
installation.
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-unpack\-tarball=FILE\fP"
Acquire .debs from tarball FILE instead of downloading via http.
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-make\-tarball=FILE\fP"
Instead of bootstrapping, make a tarball (written to FILE) of the downloaded
packages.
The resulting tarball may be passed to a later
.BR \-\-unpack\-tarball .
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-debian\-installer\fP"
Used for internal purposes by the debian-installer
.IP 
.IP "\fB\-\-extractor=TYPE\fP"
Override automatic .deb extractor selection to
.IR TYPE .
Supported extractors are: dpkg-deb and ar.
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-check\-certificate\fP"
Do not check certificate against certificate authorities
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-certificate=FILE\fP"
Use the client certificate stored in file (PEM)
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-private\-key=FILE\fP"
Read the private key from file

.SH EXAMPLES
.
.PP 
To setup an \fIascii\fR system:
.PP 
     debootstrap ascii ./ascii-chroot http://packages.devuan.org/merged
.PP
     debootstrap ascii ./ascii-chroot file:///LOCAL_MIRROR/devuan
.PP
Full process to create a complete Devuan installation of \fIceres\fR (unstable)
in a chroot:
.PP
     main # debootstrap ceres ceres-root http://packages.devuan.org/merged
     [ ... watch it download the whole system ]
     main # echo "proc ceres-root/proc proc defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
     main # mount proc ceres-root/proc -t proc
     main # echo "sysfs ceres-root/sys sysfs defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
     main # mount sysfs ceres-root/sys -t sysfs
     main # cp /etc/hosts ceres-root/etc/hosts
     main # chroot ceres-root /bin/bash
